Emulator Lua scripts for use with FCEUX.  The current version of FCEUX on the home page is 2 years out of date, and does not work properly with this script.  Grab a more recent version here: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/zeromus/fceux/build/artifacts

You will need:
* Windows
* FCEUX
* Castlevania 2 Rom (No-intro version)
* The script (or just run update.exe).

How to use:
* Place the "update.exe" file in the "LuaScripts" folder inside the FCEUX folder.
* Run "update.exe" and press "Update" button.
* Run FCEUX
* "File" --> "Open Rom... --> "Castlevania II - Simon's Quest (USA).nes"
* "File" --> "Lua" --> "New Lua Script Window..." --> "Browse..." --> (select a script such as SpiderDave_Castlevania2.lua) --> "Run"


Note: There are a lot of things unfinished, broken or exploitable at the moment :(
